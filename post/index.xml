      <title>Whisp - personal</title>

      <description>Whisp is an android app written in Kotlin that simulates phone call between user and lost loved one to help with grieving process. It is inspired by Japan&amp;rsquo;s Phone of the Wind. The feeling of communication with a lost loved one can be a very beneficial and positive way of coping with loss. With deaths on the rise this year, I wanted to bring the magic and beauty of the Phone of the Wind to smartphones for greater accessibility.</description>

      <description>Petr Chat is a multithreaded server written in C that supports chatroom messaging and management.
I employed thread execution, thread safety (mutexes and semaphores), and sockets/network connections. I also leveraged solutions to Producer-Consumer problem to create a robust and reliable application.
Note: Cannot link code to preserve academic integrity. Will have a demo up soon.</description>

      <title>TicTacToe - personal</title>

      <description>This was my first go at a Java project after self-learning for a couple months!
It was developed as a simple 2-player game of Tic Tac Toe on a text-based console. The code is broken up into 3 key classes: Main, Board, and Player.
This project displays my competence in the basics of Java and object oriented programming.
Check out the code on GitHub:
